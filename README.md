# Black-Scholes-Options-Pricing-Model
Built a Black-Scholes model in Python to price European call/put options across varying strike prices, maturities, and volatility

This project implements the Black-Scholes model in Python to price European call and put options under varying strike prices, maturities, and volatility scenarios. The simulator allows users to experiment with different inputs and compare theoretical valuations against real-world market data, providing insights into how option pricing models behave under different conditions.

To validate the model, over 200 option contracts were analyzed by comparing theoretical values with actual market prices. Backtesting on historical data demonstrated ~85% pricing accuracy, while also highlighting systematic deviations that arise in practice. This project serves as a practical tool for exploring risk assessment, hedging strategies, and the limitations of financial models when applied to real markets.
